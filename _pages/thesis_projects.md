# Thesis.

Hurray! You have embarked on that on this page I will provide some links and tips. This is still in progress, all feedback welcome.
Specifically, I cover the [Open Science Framework](./thesis_projects#open-science-framework), [Qualtrics](./thesis_projects#some-tips-for-qualtrics.), [SPSS](#some-tips-for-spss.), and [writing](./thesis_projects#writing.).

# Open Science Framework.

If you choose to complete your thesis with me, we will use the Open Science Framework. [Many reasons](https://osf.io/edhym/){:target="_blank"} exist for using the open science framework but one reason is that we have a record of what we did. It also avoids the issue of having lots of files labelled 'proposal' and finding out which one is the final one.

In time I will post more example projects, but here are already some examples to look at. All my OSF projects are [here](https://osf.io/v6cn3/).

* Lotte Groeneboom & Joanne Costello's [Thesis Project](https://osf.io/sdjxm/) on 'Red laptops'. Check the [draft paper](https://psyarxiv.com/3bfwh/) also.

## How to set up your account.

Have a look [here](http://georgiasouthern.libguides.com/c.php?g=653428&p=4585485).

## Creating a project.

Have a look [here](http://help.osf.io/m/projects)

## Setting up a registration.

Have a look [here](http://help.osf.io/m/registrations). You can see some examples by browsing the Open Science Framework. Multiple options for registations exist. If your project is a replication project, then we would follow the 'replication recipe'. Follow the details in [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2283856).

##Sharing a project

At the end of the project we might want to make it public. Information on how to do that [here](http://help.osf.io/m/sharing)

# Some tips for Qualtrics. {#some-tips-for-qualtrics.}

Qualtrics has an extensive [help file](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/) for your projects. I list some tips and tricks here.

If you have never made a Qualtrics survey, have a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkSUKTdD1Hs), [this one](http://csulb.libguides.com/c.php?g=39320&p=250415) or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hSo-ldj19k). Kent state also has an [excellent tutorial](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/qualtrics), if you don't want to watch videos. This [tutorial](https://erc.barnard.edu/qualtrics) by Barnard College (Columbia) is also useful

Before starting check out these [writing mistakes](https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/writing-survey-questions/) when making your survey.

* Unless there are reasons not to **force participants to respond**. If you want to still have the option for sensitive questions that participants are able to skip it, add “Prefer Not to Answer” as an option. [Here](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/validation/) you can see how to do that. Also look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ZwKGBm1bQ).
* **Avoid open questions** for questions like age, nationality, etc. You would end up having to do a lot of post-hoc recoding otherwise. For example, some participants will put in '30', while others will put in '30 years'. Have a long think, does that question really have to be open and how will you deal with the variety of responses which you will inevitably get.
* Make sure participants do not have to scroll endlessly. Use [page breaks](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/add-page-break/) . Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PibtvW9mFP8)
* [Randomize your questions](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/block-options/question-randomization/). [Check this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45F3pliI8HY). Note that it might disrupt your page breaks. When in doubt make separate blocks.
* When you are making your survey, I will require full access to it. [Here](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/my-projects/sharing-a-project/) you find explained how to share it. Make sure I have full rights!

# Some tips for SPSS.

There are a lot of useful SPSS tutorials. For example, look at the one from [Kent State University](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS) or this [one](https://www.spss-tutorials.com/basics/). If you get stuck, do not forget that google is your friend. If you run into problems, I expect that you have *at minimum* googled the problem. In the future, I'll post common issues listed here.

##Graph and table misery.

As discussed in my [post](https://tvpollet.github.io/2018-02-19-SPSS/), I often see terribly formatted graphs (and actually I have been [guilty](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx0aG9tYXN2cG9sbGV0fGd4OjcxZTcxYjRjYmFkZmIxNDM) of myself. There thus are no longer any excuses for terribly formatted figures and tables.

##Recoding variables.

Have a look [here](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/RecodeVariables)

##Recoding missing with value.
If you did not manage to put a 'force' choice in Qualtrics, you'll end up with the rare missings. Often you'll want to replace a few missing cases with the means. have a look [here](http://www.unige.ch/ses/sococ/cl/spss/trans/recodem.html)

##Missings.
Have a look [here](https://www.spss-tutorials.com/spss-missing-values-tutorial/). Note that summing across missings will create problems, look at [this](https://www.spss-tutorials.com/spss-sum-cautionary-note/).

##Conduct a one-way ANOVA.

Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYn5Jv7Gh4s)

##More advanced SPSS madness.

###Logistic regression.

If you are unlucky enough to have to run a logistic regression, then we often want [information criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection#Criteria) and/or [likelihood ratio tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test). I had to find out how to get those. It turns out that the binomial logistic regression module in SPSS does not provide this, but the multinomial logistic regression module does (see [this](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21478171).

##Writing.

###Scientific writing.
I will list some resources on how to become a better writer. To be honest, I am a terrible writer and thus not the best placed to offer you advice. The best advice is to write often and rewrite. In the beginning do not waste a lot of time on formatting, save that for the end. Set yourself targets (e.g., 200-500 words for a day) and once you have a terrible first draft, flesh it out. Especially at the start of your project force yourself to write chunks often and then rewrite.

Some further tips:

* Steven Pinker's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0143127799) on style.
* [Seven tips on how to write better](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201105/seven-tips-writing-good-paper).
* [Essay writing for psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/psychology-essay.html)
* Harvard's [writing for psychology](https://writingproject.fas.harvard.edu/files/hwp/files/writing_for_psych_final_from_printer.pdf)
* [Writing in Psychology](https://writingcenter.uconn.edu/writing-in-psychology-4/), University of Connecticut.

If you are struggling with writing and starting your essay/thesis also consider [booking a session](https://cragside.northumbria.ac.uk/Everyone/skillsplus/database_uploads/55389339.pdf?) in the library.

###Reporting statistics.
APA style is the standard for your report, for most statistics standardized formats exist. Go back to your statistics notes. Still confused, look at these resources:

* [Reporting Statistics in APA Format](https://production.wordpress.uconn.edu/writingcenterwp1/wp-content/uploads/sites/593/2014/06/Reporting_Statistics1.pdf), University of Connecticut.
* [Abbreviations / APA style](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~grahamh/RM1web/APA%20format%20for%20statistical%20notation%20and%20other%20things.pdf)
* [Statistics for psychology](http://staff.bath.ac.uk/pssiw/stats2/page2/page3/page3.html) , University of Bath.

As always google is your friend, and you are not the first one wondering how to write up your results in APA style.

###Software.
I have also moved away from MS word and towards writing first draft in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), I am still oscillating between [RStudio](www.rstudio.com), [Macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) and [Atom](http://atom.io). I also have looked at [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) but that's perhaps more suitable for much longer pieces. If I ever find the optimal solution I will let you know.

###References.

Use referencing software! Do not waste your time on editing references manually. This is error prone and takes up a lot of your time - which you could spend writing! No excuse not to use one!

Northumbria university offers [Endnote](https://onsizzle.com/i/does-referencing-without-endnote-2107536). But spend some time looking into [mendeley](www.mendeley.com) or [zotero](www.zotero.org). [Papers](https://www.readcube.com/papers/), although it comes at a cost after a 30 day trial, is also worth having a look at.

* Mendeley has [great video resources](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/videos), explaining how it works and how to use the MS word plugin.
* Zotero also has [great documentation](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide).
* For Endnote you can book a session in [the library](https://cragside.northumbria.ac.uk/Everyone/skillsplus/database_uploads/55389339.pdf?).

If you are using RStudio, it is [easy to cite](https://www.r-bloggers.com/writing-manuscripts-in-rstudio-easy-citations/) or have a look at [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja).
