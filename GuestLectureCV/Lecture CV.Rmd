## Resumes and social media.

* Introduction

* How to evaluate resumes? (What's the evidence?)

* How to improve your resume?

* Facebook and LinkedIn


---
## Why should you care?

* It is often your first contact with a potential employer

```
---
## Importance <sup>1,2</sup>

* The first communication between an applicant and prospective employer

--

* Most often used selection instrument:
    
    1. Relatively inexpensive 
    2. Overview of experience, education, knowledge, skills
    3. Judgment of personality, cognitive ability, fit

--

* Recruiters spend < 10 seconds reviewing a resume

--> First impressions matter!

## What can we reliably assess.

Recruiters use resumes to evaluate ability and other personality-related attributes (e.g., motivation, leadership) 

--

However, evaluations of hiring recommendations and personality judgments are highly idiosyncratic

--> For example, Burns et al. (2014) found an ICC of 0.07 for overall hireability ratings

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

```


---
##What can we validly assess?

Burns et al. (2014) found that actual applicant personality hardly explains hiring recommendations, it is the _perceptions_ of personality that are important

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("brunswik.png")
```

---
##What do recruiters find important? <sup>1,2</sup>

**Cognitive ability**:

Academic achievement
Maintaining a full-time job
Supervising others (+ low agreeableness)

--

**Extraversion, Openness to experience, and Emotional stability**:

Extracurricular and volunteer experiences

--

**Conscientiousness**:

Academic achievement
GPA
Internships
Professional and study associations
Awards

##What do recruiters find important?

**Hireability <sup>1</sup>**:

Provide detailed information about education, including honors and awards

Use school e-mail address over personal addresses

Avoid making your resume stand out by applying unusual fonts or formats (to names)

Provide education information before experience information

Include all leadership roles and financial returns

Include information on extracurricular and volunteer experiences

###Take-home messages.

* Use cognitive ability tests and personality questionnaires to measure these constructs

--

* Use resumes to check whether applicants fulfill the **minimum** requirements of the job, do not use them to assess cognitive ability or personality

--

* Resume evaluation is idiosyncratic: Explicate any lay theories you might have about what makes a candidate suitable and search for scientific evidence before using such theories.
